# Prominence II RPG: Hasturian Era
**v3.0.0 - A New Beginning**

This update does NOT need a world reset, but it is encouraged due to how much stuff has changed, but it is ultimately up to you!

## Important Changes
- **The Hasturian Era Begins.** This update introduces both the final chapter of Void's Invasion, and the start of Hasturian Era.
- **Complete Talent Tree Overhaul**, featuring 15 passives, 8 active abilities and +100 stat talents!
- **Player Leveling!** With talent points earned every 2 levels! The maximum level in Hasturian Era is 65, if you update from void's invasion, your level will be set automatically.
- **Artifact Upgrade Trees.** Upgrade your artifact with its own upgrade tree that contains stat increases and passives!
- **Mob Scaling**, tied to player levels with multiplayer support.
- **New Ability Books:**
  - Warrior's Codex (Melee Burst Skills)
  - Rogue Handbook (Melee DPS Skills)
  - Tome of the Eternal Winter (Melee DPS Skills)
- **Corruption System.** A high risk high reward system where you get stronger but fall into madness. With integration between talents & artifact tree passives.
- **Infusion System.** Find infusion smithing templates to infuse Etyr and Corruption into any weapon, armor, or tool.
- **Cinderstone Trophies.** A new item has been added that allows you to craft QoL items such as the Explorer's Compass, among others. Their recipes were adjusted to require this item, which is dropped by campaign bosses or made using mythical essences! Making these useful items accessible later on in the gameplay.
- **A rewritten Void's Invasion.** Following an Elden Ring inspired writing style, and focusing more on the story with slightly cryptic indications.
- **Spanish Translations!** The Void's Invasion and Hasturian Era storylines are now also in Spanish. This does not apply to other questlines due to it being a very time consuming task for me. Other languages aren't planned as of now, as I only speak english and spanish.

## What's coming next?
