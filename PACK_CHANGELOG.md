# Prominence II RPG: Hasturian Era
**3.0.10 - Health Overhaul & Blood Death Knights**

This update brings two new big things: A new tank class; the Blood Death Knight. And most importantly, a health overhaul.

From now on, players will start gaining max HP based when they level up. Enemy damage was adjusted and the max hp given by gear and talents was too; the S'kellak's Blessing fate now grants +100 Max HP.

For more info about this, read the [blog post that explains these changes](https://rpg.prominence.wiki/blog/3.0.10-changes)

## Important Changes
- **Health Overhaul**: Players will now gain health each level. Talents and armor sets have been adjusted to better suit tank builds, and damage was re-adjusted.

- **New Frostmourne Model**: A new model for the Frostmourne artifact has been forged.

- **Healthbars**. The hearts in the HUD have been completely replaced with a healthbar, so it's easier to see your HP in later stages 
- **PvP**: Thanks to the new HP changes, PvP is in a better state in the late/end game. It still is not fully balanced, but a PvP focused update will come in the future.

# Prominence II RPG: Hasturian Era
**v3.0.0 - A New Beginning**

This update does NOT need a world reset, but it is encouraged due to how much stuff has changed, but it is ultimately up to you!

## Important Changes

- **Complete Talent Tree Overhaul**, featuring 16 passives, 9 active abilities and +100 stat talents!
- **Player Leveling!** With talent points earned every 2 levels! The maximum level in Hasturian Era is 65, if you update from void's invasion, your level will be set automatically.
- **Artifact Upgrade Trees.** Upgrade your artifact with its own upgrade tree that contains stat increases and passives!
- **Mob Scaling**, tied to player levels with multiplayer support.
- **New Class: The Bard**, a new custom class that buffs allies by playing music, with different buffs depending on the instrument, and they can even ANY song too, by just drag and dropping the MIDI files! This class will be expanded further in updates with custom armor sets and spells too!
- **New Ability Books:**
  - Warrior's Codex (Melee Burst Skills)

- **A rewritten Void's Invasion.** Following an Elden Ring inspired writing style, and focusing more on the story with slightly cryptic indications.
- **Spanish Translations!** The Void's Invasion and Hasturian Era storylines are now also in Spanish. This does not apply to other questlines due to it being a very time consuming task for me. Other languages aren't planned as of now, as I only speak english and spanish.
